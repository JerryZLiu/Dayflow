Titles
Each title is a memory trigger. Be specific enough that it could only describe one situation.
"Bug fixes" could be anything. "Fixed the infinite scroll crash on search results" can only be one thing.
"Gaming session" could be any day. "League ARAM — Thresh and Jinx" is a specific session.

Use honest verbs
The verb matters. Pick the one that describes what actually happened, not the one that sounds most professional.
If someone was browsing a product page and picking options, they were "speccing out" a purchase — not "configuring" it (that implies they already own it). If someone scheduled a meeting, they "scheduled" it — not "coordinated" it. If someone was scrolling a feed, they were "scrolling" — not "catching up on industry news."
The wrong verb changes the memory. Get it right even if it sounds less impressive.

Accuracy over polish
Don't compress what happened into a technical-sounding phrase that loses the meaning. If the actual bug was "the notification wasn't showing up after regeneration," say that — don't abstract it into "verification pipeline error" because it sounds more engineered.
The title's job is to be TRUE and SPECIFIC, not to sound smart. When in doubt, describe the actual problem or action in plain language.

Titles can be longer
A title that's a few words longer but triggers a real memory beats a short vague one every time. Don't trim useful detail for brevity. Aim for roughly 5–15 words — but if word 12 is the one that makes you remember, keep it.

Banned words
These are corporate filler. No human writes them in a journal:
"research," "coordination," "management," "administration," "workflow," "sync," "alignment," "exploration," "investigation," "project development," "social chat," "various," "multiple," "several," "deep dive," "rabbit hole"
Don't just avoid these exact words — avoid the energy. "Analyzing" is just "research" in a lab coat. "Refining" is just "working on" trying to sound important. "Coordinated" is "scheduled" wearing a tie. If you wouldn't say it out loud to a friend, it's too formal.

Examples

BAD: "Debugging issues" → GOOD: "Tracked down the Stripe webhook timeout"
BAD: "Housing search and social media browsing" → GOOD: "Found a 2BR on Elm Street on Zillow"
BAD: "Meeting coordination" → GOOD: "Scheduled coffee with Priya for Thursday"
BAD: "Tech news and social media browsing" → GOOD: "Reading about the new Pixel launch on X"
BAD: "Gaming session and social chat" → GOOD: "Overwatch ranked — hit Diamond with Sara"
BAD: "Subscription management" → GOOD: "Downgraded my Spotify to free tier"
BAD: "Project development and code review" → GOOD: "Reviewed Jake's auth PR"
BAD: "Financial research and subscription management" → GOOD: "Talked to Marcus about REIT picks"

Multiple activities
Just describe what happened naturally. Use commas, "and," "+," "between" — whatever reads well. Vary the structure so titles don't all sound the same.

"Fixing the login redirect between YouTube and Reddit breaks"
"Texted Priya about Saturday, caught up on NFL draft news"
"Postgres migration + updated the Terraform config"
"Poking at the CORS bug (mostly distracted)"

If one activity is clearly the main thing, just name that one. The rest goes in the summary.

Final check

Could this title describe 100 different situations? → Too vague, add the specific detail.
Would a human actually write this? → If it sounds corporate, rewrite it.
Will this bring back a specific memory? → If not, name the concrete thing.
Is the verb honest? → Does it describe what actually happened, or a fancier version of it?
"""

    static let summaryBlock = """
## Summary

2-3 sentences max. First person without "I". Just state what happened.

Good:
- "Refactored the auth module in React, added OAuth support. Hit CORS issues with the backend API."
- "Designed landing page mockups in Figma. Exported assets and started building it in Next.js."
- "Searched flights to Tokyo, coordinated dates with Evan and Anthony over Messages. Looked at Shibuya apartments on Blueground."

Bad:
- "Kicked off the morning by diving into design work before transitioning to development tasks." (filler, vague)
- "Started with refactoring before moving on to debugging some issues." (wordy, no specifics)
- "The session involved multiple context switches between different parts of the application." (says nothing)

Never use:
- "kicked off", "dove into", "started with", "began by"
- Third person ("The session", "The work")
- Mental states or assumptions about why the person did something
"""

    static let detailedSummaryBlock = """
## Detailed Summary

This is the "show me exactly what happened" view. Every app, every switch, every action.

Format each line as:
[H:MM AM/PM] - [H:MM AM/PM]: [specific action] [in app/tool] [on what]

Include:
- Specific file/document names when visible
- Page titles, tabs, search queries
- Actions: opened, edited, scrolled, searched, replied, watched
- Content context: what topic, what section, who you messaged

Good example:
"7:00 AM - 7:08 AM: edited "Q4 Launch Plan" in Notion, added timeline section
7:08 AM - 7:10 AM: replied to Mike in Slack #engineering
7:10 AM - 7:12 AM: scrolled X home feed
7:12 AM - 7:18 AM: back to Notion, wrote launch risks section
7:18 AM - 7:20 AM: searched Google "feature flag best practices"
7:20 AM - 7:25 AM: read LaunchDarkly docs
7:25 AM - 7:30 AM: added feature flag notes to Notion doc"

Bad example:
"7:00 AM - 7:30 AM writing Notion doc
7:30 AM - 7:35 AM: Slack
7:35 AM - 8:00 AM coding"
(Too coarse — what doc? which Slack channel? coding what?)

The goal: someone could reconstruct exactly what you did just from the detailed summary.
